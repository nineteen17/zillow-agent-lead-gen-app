## 📞 **Follow-Up Call Script**

Use this if the agent responds positively:

**Opening:**
> "Hi [AGENT], thanks for your interest! I wanted to quickly walk you through how it works and answer any questions."

**Explain the platform (2 mins):**
- We're a Zillow-style platform for NZ
- 50k monthly visitors searching for properties
- We match buyer/seller leads to agents by suburb
- You get exclusive access to your chosen suburbs

**Address common objections:**

**Q: "How do you get the leads?"**
A: "Users come for free property valuations, suburb stats, and market trends. When they want to talk to an agent, we match them to you based on their suburb."

**Q: "What's the lead quality like?"**
A: "These are high-intent leads - people actively researching property values and market conditions. Much better than cold leads."

**Q: "What if I don't get enough leads?"**
A: "14-day free trial - if you're not happy, cancel and pay nothing. Most agents see 5-15 leads in the first month depending on their suburb and tier."

**Closing:**
> "Want me to set you up with a free trial for [SUBURB]? I can have you live in 5 minutes."

## 📝 **Tips for Successful Outreach**

**Do:**
- ✅ Personalize every email (mention their suburb, agency)
- ✅ Focus on ROI, not features
- ✅ Offer free trial (removes risk)
- ✅ Follow up 3-4 times (most sales happen on follow-up #3)
- ✅ Use social proof (testimonials, case studies)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Send generic mass emails
- ❌ Be pushy or aggressive
- ❌ Over-promise ("100 leads guaranteed!")
- ❌ Ignore objections
- ❌ Give up after 1 email

**Best Times to Email:**
- Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 2-4pm
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (weekend mindset)

**Success Metrics:**
- **Open rate target:** 40-50%
- **Reply rate target:** 10-15%
- **Conversion to trial:** 5-10%
- **Trial to paid:** 30-40%

**Example Funnel:**
- 100 emails sent
- 40 opened (40%)
- 10 replied (10%)
- 5 started trial (5%)
